        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My professional journey through UPS Freight and Cloudstaff has sharpened my customer service acumen to a fine edge. I have demonstrated proficiency in LTL shipping, encompassing tracking, quoting, and billing, while skillfully resolving intricate issues with efficiency. My tenure at Cloudstaff allowed me to perfect my email communication skills within a B2B 3PL environment, where I also took the initiative to train new hires and significantly enhance team efficiency. I bring an adaptable and resourceful mindset to the table, coupled with a robust capacity for problem-solving. I am keenly seeking a challenging role where I can deploy these competencies to drive success.
